<h1>Bink Video with 3D Rendering</h1>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Bink's design makes it very easy to integrate into a 3D rendering pipeline. In fact, depending on the platform, Bink gives you lots of ways to draw video inside your 3D game, all of which have different pros and cons. Let's discuss the options. </p><p>1) You can use <a href="BinkCopyToBuffer.html">BinkCopyToBuffer</a> to blast directly to the back buffer before you flip or swap. This is the most compatible and fastest way to play back your video. However, this option doesn't allow your video to be stretched by the hardware. Depending on the resolution of your movies and game, this may or may not be a problem. PROS: fast, widely compatible. CONS: video can't be stretched, color conversion is done is software (except on GameCube). </p><p>2) You can blit on top of the primary 3D surface (by using BinkBuffers, for example). In this option, you simply call the 2D blitting functions of the platform to blit onto the screen after you do the Present or SwapBuffers. The problem with this option is that some PC and Mac video cards don't support it correctly. It might work fine on your machine, but it could fail on older video cards. So, we don't recommend this option unless you know it will always work (like on a console or embedded system). PROS: none, there are better solutions. CONS: it will fail - don't use this method (put another way - don't use the BinkBuffer API while the 3D system is running). </p><p>3) You can use a 3D texture and then render the texture orthographically. This is a good option, because the 3D hardware can stretch your video to fill the screen. We supply high-level example code that handles the textures and vertices to use this method for most platforms. The only downside to this option is the "texture swizzling" hit. </p><p>Texture swizzling means that the 3D hardware requires that the texels in a texture be re-ordered so that they can be accessed more rapidly. Almost all 3D hardware swizzles the texels by default. The problem with this re-ordering is that it is usually performed on the host CPU (and slowly at that)! For example, on a Pentium III and with a geForce II graphics card, playing back a 640x480 video uses 90% of the CPU time just for texture swizzling! This doesn't leave Bink with much CPU time. </p><p>Fortunately, as game companies played video through the 3D system more and more (usually with Bink), the video cards exposed a new hint in the 3D APIs called "dynamic textures" or "linear textures". This hint tells the 3D card to access the textures linearly instead of in swizzled format (even if this causes rasterization to run slightly slower). On that same P3/geForce II setup, using dynamic textures on D3D drops the CPU use from 90% to less than 1%! </p><p>However, there are still some cards that don't support dynamic/linear textures at all (or they could even have old drivers installed that don't support the linear flags), so you should always have a fallback when using 3D textures. For this fallback, you can either just use the back buffer method (which we recommend), or ship smaller videos for slower machines. Smaller videos can be swizzled up to the video card faster (a 320x240 video will swizzle at least 4 times faster than a 640x480 video). </p><p>Note that swizzling on the consoles isn't too big of an issue because the Xbox supports linear textures, and the GameCube version of Bink swizzles directly to the GameCube texture format (which is documented and simple). </p><p>PROS: hardware stretching, widely compatible. CONS: may be too slow on PCs and Macs - make sure you have a fallback. </p><p>4) You can use an overlay surface. Overlays float above the 3D (and 2D) surfaces, so they don't affect your 3D rendering at all. The only problem here is compatibility. On most Windows video cards, overlays aren't reliable enough to use widely (especially while the 3D system is active). On the Xbox (where the overlay system is robust and ubiquitous), this is definitely the best option. PROS: very fastest option (color conversion and stretching done in hardware), no interference with your 3D system, great quality. CONS: only reliable on Xbox or embedded systems. </p><p>So, what option should you use? Well, it depends on your platform. Here are our recommendations: </p><p>PCs (Windows, MacOS and GNU/Linux): Use the back buffer method by default. If your game can run at higher resolution than your videos, allow the user to select the 3D texture method to stretch the video to full screen. Remember that since many machines won't be able to swizzle the data fast enough, always default to using the back buffer method! We've had customers fail to do this and they always regretted it later. </p><p>Microsoft Xbox: Use the overlay method. It's super fast, it looks the best, and it doesn't interfere with your rendering system. Xbox also supports linear textures, so there is no swizzling cost if you do want to use the 3D texture method (there is still software color conversion cost, though). </p><p>Nintendo GameCube: Use the back buffer method - the GameCube backbuffer is YUV (the Bink native format), so we simply have to copy the bytes over with no color conversion. If you want to use the 3D texture method, BinkCopyToBuffer outputs in GameCube swizzled format directly, so there is no swizzling penalty (but the software color conversion CPU hit will still be there). </p>
