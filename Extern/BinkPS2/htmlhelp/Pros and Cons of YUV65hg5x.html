<h1>Pros and Cons of YUV Overlays under Win32</h1>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p><b>YUV Overlays are good, because:</b> </p><p>1) They are super-fast (you don't blit them to the screen, you just draw onto the surface and the pixels appear). </p><p>2) They have clipping built-in. </p><p>3) They float above your application, so they don't disturb anything in your application. </p><p>4) They can do shrinking and stretching for free, CPU-wise. </p><p><br> <b>YUV overlays are bad, because:</b> </p><p>1) They are hardware (so you are at the mercy of the video card and video card DirectDraw drivers). </p><p>2) They can look different on different video cards (especially when stretching). </p><p>3) They float above your application, so it's hard to make them seem completely integrated into your application. </p><p>4) They are usually disabled when Direct3D is running. </p>
