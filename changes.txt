	- Fixed a possible issue that might arise when using the "Full Maximized" while a frame is already maximized

	- Fixed an oversight with the group association function (thanks to Droolie!)
	- Fixed audio subsystem not initialising again until restart when switching between projects

	- Introduced a new splash screen
	- Translated internal exception warning to English
	- Translated material-type names to English
	- Removed "Perforce Refresh" option from Browser, given it's redundant now
	- SSE optimisations are now used by the editor
	- Bumped engine limits to match Droolie's fork
	- Changed how 3D View "Full Maximized" works, so it behaves more like a borderless fullscreen mode
	- Changed drag-camera shortcut to use SHIFT instead of ALT, as ALT is causing problems
	- A debug dump will automatically be generated, if possible, if and when the application crashes
	- Renamed editor executable to "Jaded" to avoid conflicts with other fan bug-fixes
	- Editor will now use newer common controls (i.e. more modern appearance)
	- Overhauled joystick input to use SDL2's game controller API instead of DirectInput
	- Disabled prompt if warnings are present in log (obnoxious and unnecessary imo)
	- Switched over to using GLEW for handling GL extensions
	- Removed Perforce tool panels and eliminated Perforce-related requests

-----------------------------------------------------------

2023-05-xx (v0.2.0)
- Added support for anisotropic filtering (automatically used if texture is using mipmaps w/ max supported samples)
- Fixed several potential buffer-overflows
- Fixed audio subsystem not initialising again until restart when switching between projects
- Fixed an issue with blurry textures resulting from very pessimistic assumptions about available VRAM/RAM

- Simplified mipmap generation (works best if you have an OpenGL 3+ capable card)
- Introduced a new splash screen
- Translated internal exception warning to English

- Continued massaging in JADEFUSION changes

2023-04-19
- Introduced fix for ShiftUsingNormal flag using wrong variable for storage (thanks Droolie!)
	WARNING: this will break materials using fur in the original leaked BF, to resolve please use Droolie's patched BF via the link below.

- Removed some redundant checks
- Disabled Perforce log
- Now using C standard stdint.h, rather than Ubisoft's own, given we no longer live in the dark ages

	+ You can now unplug/plug a controller in during run-time to your hearts content <3

- Continued removing Perforce integration
- Improvements to the "Run Engine (Speed)" option
	+ Now automatically enables fog
	+ Automatically sets 'Active Engine World' if necessary
	+ Renamed so it's a little more obvious what it does; "Run Engine (Game Mode)"
	(still not a perfect name, but to explain this will basically hide all editor-specific information and automatically set camera to engine)
- Fixed an exception that was thrown upon duplicating an object
- Fixed crash that occurred with prefab preview
- Fixed a crash that occurred in the last release when opening a material
	+ This gave me an opportunity to clean up a lot of this, so generally it should be a lot more stable!

- Fixed some issues with the OpenGL backend which could potentially cause issues w/ modern drivers
- Fixed missing key error by automatically setting it up on launch if it doesn't exist
- Fixed an issue with displaying paletted textures on some AMD GPUs / drivers
	disclaimer: might incorrectly display some textures due to nature of fix, but I've not encountered any issues
