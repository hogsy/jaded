2023-01-16
- Overhauled joystick input to use SDL2's game controller API instead of DirectInput

2023-01-15
- Enabled "Jade Fusion" clipboard toggle for material editor
- Cleaned up elements of the interface to display better with new common controls
- Continued removing Perforce integration
- Improvements to the "Run Engine (Speed)" option
	+ Now automatically enables fog
	+ Automatically sets 'Active Engine World' if necessary
	+ Renamed so it's a little more obvious what it does; "Run Engine (Game Mode)"
	(still not a perfect name, but to explain this will basically hide all editor-specific information and automatically set camera to engine)
- Fixed an exception that was thrown upon duplicating an object
- Fixed crash that occurred with prefab preview
- Fixed a crash that occurred in the last release when opening a material
	+ This gave me an opportunity to clean up a lot of this, so generally it should be a lot more stable!
