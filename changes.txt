hogsy's Jade Engine patches
-----------------------------------------------------------
- Rotating and moving the camera around should no longer slow to a crawl, particularly with the browser open
- Introduced a rough FPS cap when running the engine within the editor
- Editor will now use newer common controls (i.e. more modern appearance)
- Started gradually scraping out Perforce code (will replace with a better solution in long-term)
- Fixed flickering with animation graph
- Fixed malformed strings in texture editor
- Fixed some issues with the OpenGL backend which could potentially cause issues w/ modern drivers
- Fixed missing key error by automatically setting it up on launch if it doesn't exist
- Fixed an issue with displaying paletted textures on some AMD GPUs / drivers
	disclaimer: might incorrectly display some textures due to nature of fix, but I've not encountered any issues
