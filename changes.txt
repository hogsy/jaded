hogsy's Jade Engine patches (hogsy@oldtimes-software.com / hogsy#9210)
-----------------------------------------------------------
2023-01-xx
- Added "Limit FPS" toggle under "Engine" menu
- Disabled prompt if warnings are present in log (obnoxious and unnecessary imo)
2023-01-16
- Overhauled joystick input to use SDL2's game controller API instead of DirectInput
	+ Fixed input issue when unplugging a controller at run-time
	+ You can now unplug/plug a controller in during run-time to your hearts content <3
- Disabled FPS cap for now (will provide a toggle next release)
- Fixed a crash when attempting to open a different level from the browser while the engine is active
2023-01-15
- Enabled "Jade Fusion" clipboard toggle for material editor
- Cleaned up elements of the interface to display better with new common controls
- Continued removing Perforce integration
- Improvements to the "Run Engine (Speed)" option
	+ Now automatically enables fog
	+ Automatically sets 'Active Engine World' if necessary
	+ Renamed so it's a little more obvious what it does; "Run Engine (Game Mode)"
	(still not a perfect name, but to explain this will basically hide all editor-specific information and automatically set camera to engine)
- Fixed an exception that was thrown upon duplicating an object
- Fixed crash that occurred with prefab preview
- Fixed a crash that occurred in the last release when opening a material
	+ This gave me an opportunity to clean up a lot of this, so generally it should be a lot more stable!
- Fixed error dialog when performing check on BF
- Fixed BF check displaying nothing for some invalid entries, now will display key if no valid name exists
2023-01-05
- Rotating and moving the camera around should no longer slow to a crawl, particularly with the browser open
- Introduced a rough FPS cap when running the engine within the editor
- Editor will now use newer common controls (i.e. more modern appearance)
- Started gradually scraping out Perforce code (will replace with a better solution in long-term)
- Fixed flickering with animation graph
- Fixed malformed strings in texture editor
- Fixed some issues with the OpenGL backend which could potentially cause issues w/ modern drivers
- Fixed missing key error by automatically setting it up on launch if it doesn't exist
- Fixed an issue with displaying paletted textures on some AMD GPUs / drivers
	disclaimer: might incorrectly display some textures due to nature of fix, but I've not encountered any issues
